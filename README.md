## Introduction

This repo is based on my code of University of Southern California course EE599- Deep Learning, the code include each HW and Final project, coded in Python. 
<p>HW1-HW3 are implement of different kinds of Neural Networks </p>
HW4 used CNN to classify facial emotion 

## STEP1

This is the first step of a Deep Learning experience - begin familiar with basic python language and some useful pakage.

## STEP2

In this homework, I implement a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network in the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), 

## STEP3
In this homework, I design a filter

## STEP4
This homework was based on a Kaggle competion, I was aimed to designed a image classifer to classify human emotion on there face image

## STEP5
This homework was audio processing, I was aimed to detect the language spoken in the audio.
