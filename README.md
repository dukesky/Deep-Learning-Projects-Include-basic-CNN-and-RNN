## HW1

This is my project code of EE599- Deep Learning, the code include each HW and Final project, coded in Python.
<p>HW1-HW3 are implement of different kinds of Neural Networks </p>
HW4 used CNN to classify facial emotion 

## HW2

In this homework, I implement a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network in the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), 

## HW3
In this homework, I design a filter

## HW4
This homework was based on a Kaggle competion, I was aimed to designed a image classifer to classify human emotion on there face image

## HW5
This homework was audio processing, I was aimed to detect the language spoken in the audio.
