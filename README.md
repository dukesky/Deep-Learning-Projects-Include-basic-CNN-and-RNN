## Introduction

This repo is based on my code of **University of Southern California course EE599- Deep Learning**, the code include each HomeWork (5 in all), coded in Python. 
* HW1-HW3 are implementation of basic deep learning conception, such as **Multi-Layer-Perceptron** and **Back-Propogation** and steps to get familiar with python machine learning toolkit, such as numpy, sklearn, etc 
* HW4 is a image processing problem, used CNN to classify facial emotion from celebrity image dataset 
* HW5 is a natrual language processing problem, used RNN to classify spoken language in audios

## STEP1 begin familiar with python pakage

This is the first step of a Deep Learning experience - begin familiar with basic python language and some useful toolkit pakage.

## STEP2 implement MLP in MNIST Dataset

In this homework, I implement a Multi Layer Perceptron Neural Network in the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), 

## STEP3 back propogation
In this homework, I design a filter and implement back propogation

## STEP4 human emotion classification (CNN)
This homework was based on a Kaggle competion, I was aimed to designed a image classifer to classify human emotion on there face image

## STEP5 language detection (RNN)
This homework was audio processing, I was aimed to detect the language spoken in the audio.
